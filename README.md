# ACBase
This is a client base used for my AssaultCube development

# How to use

You can either use the pre-compiled binary or compile in Visual Studio 2019
Use any injector of your choice, I prefer GH-Injector
Enjoy!

# How to compile
Make sure you are on x86 Debug config
Build the solution 
The dll should be found in the debug folder in the sln directory

# Documentation
Documentation can be found in the source code
There is a ExamleHack that I made to clearly show how you would use this

This is only a basic template of how I like to create hacks, this is in no way
supposed to be used for anything complex. I coded this in about an hour and expect
alot of bugs and inefficient code. Please be nice.
